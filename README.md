# Mobile Service Center
I developed a mobile and laptop service center code in Python for both customers and staff, enabling service requests, cost estimation, service tracking, and management. 
The Owner class authenticated users, managed data, and provided various functionalities. The Customer class facilitated logins, registrations, and work status checks. 
The program efficiently calculated service costs and completion times based on device type and service, enhancing overall service center operations.
